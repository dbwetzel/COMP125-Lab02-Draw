# Lab 2 - Draw!

*Use P5 basic shape functions to draw a picture*

In the first Lab, you created a new P5.js by adding some code to a file called "script.js". Credit for that lab is awarded for successfully setting up a Replit account and successfully linking a Repl to the P5.js code library. For some of you, that might have been a leap of faith already.

Now it's time to actually write some code that will generate your own graphics in a browser window! You should carefully read **Chapter 3 - Draw** in McCarthy, et al: *Make: Getting Started with P5.js.* Consider using this lab as a place to try out some of the examples in chapter 3.

- Edit the file "script.js" to create something original.
- NOTE: In your script, there should be only one instance of setup() and only one instance of draw()!

This lab is worth **10 points**, allocated according to the following criteria/rubric:

- 1 - 4 points: Generate at least four different shapes, using at least three of the following basic shape functions:
  - point()
  - line()
  - rect()
  - ellipse()
  - triangle()
- 1 - 3 points: Apply color, line weighting, and advanced shape techniques with at least three of the following:
  - fill()
  - stroke()
  - strokeWeight()
  - arc()
  - vertex() (with appropriate use of beginShape() and endShape() )
  - a for() loop to draw a repetitive pattern
- 1 - 2 points: Creativity
  - full points if the image that appears on the canvas is a coherent composite image made up of multiple basic shapes
  - 1 point if the image is disjointed or incoherent, or is mostly derivative of one of the textbook examples
- 1 point: Submitted complete and on time
  - source code uploaded to Sakai as .zip archive or as individual files (index.html + script.js) 
  - link to the project included in the Sakai submission comments box (copy from the address bar in your browser)
